            <h2>Initial Approach: Native Development with Kotlin</h2>
            <p>
                The project initially started with the development of a native Android application using Kotlin. The
                choice was driven by Kotlin's robust tooling and seamless integration with Android Studio, offering high
                performance for Android devices. However, this approach limited our application's accessibility as it
                was not available on iOS devices, restricting user reach.

            <h2>Transition to React Native</h2>
            <p>
                To overcome the limitation of platform exclusivity and embrace a cross-platform solution, the
                development shifted to React Native. This framework would enable us to target both Android and iOS
                platforms
                simultaneously, potentially doubling our user base. React Native's component-based architecture promised
                faster development cycles and reusability of code.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, I encountered significant challenges in rendering performance when attempting to display a
                large number of garden plot elements, each representing 0.1 cubic meters of a user's garden. This issue
                was critical as it affected the core functionality of allowing users to interactively manage their
                garden plots.

            <h2>Switch to Web Development</h2>
            <p>
                Given the performance constraints with React Native, the project pivoted to a web-based application.
                This decision was informed by the scalability and accessibility of web technologies, which allow users
                to access the application from any device with a web browser, regardless of the operating system. Web
                development also provided more robust solutions for handling the potentially intensive rendering needed
                for the
                detailed garden plot visualizations.
            </p>
            <p>I also realized that my knowledge of mobile and web development was surface-level at best and that I was
                unprepared for the whole scope of the task. Web development can not be picked up or learned by osmosis
                in the same way that data analysis tasks or smaller scope projects can be. To prepare for the
                development of the GartenApp I had to learn Web Development from scratch. I started out learning html
                and css using Mozilla's mdn web docs guides on html, css, and javascript. </p>
