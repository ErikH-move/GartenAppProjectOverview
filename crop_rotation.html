            <h2>Crop rotation</h2>
            <p>Gardening, at all scales from personal to agricultural, incorporates several intersecting variables which
                must be properly managed to achieve optimal productivity and sustainability. These factors encompass
                specific plant needs (e.g., optimal and absolute temperature range, light intensity, amount of
                irrigation),
                soil health (soil structure and consistency, color, fertility), resource allocation (labor, irrigation),
                pest and disease management, and seasonal and climatic considerations (minimum and maximum temperature,
                precipitation, sunshine hours, frost depth).</p>
            <p>A particularly critical practice is crop rotation. Crop rotation is a systematic and strategic method
                practiced in agriculture and horticulture, involving the sequential cultivation of different crops on
                the
                same land over a specified period. The fundamental principle behind crop rotation lies in the biological
                differences among crops. Different crops have variable nutrient requirements, growth patterns, and
                susceptibility to pests and diseases. By altering the type of crops grown on a specific plot over time,
                it
                is possible to disrupt the life cycles of pests and diseases and balance the soil nutrient profile.

            </p>
            <p>For example, leguminous crops (such as peas and beans) exhibit symbiotic relationships with atmospheric
                nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Following a nitrogen-demanding crop, like corn, with a legume can replenish
                the
                soil's nitrogen content. Similarly, alternating between deep-rooted and shallow-rooted crops can improve
                nutrient utilization.<sup><a href="sources.html#moncada2010"

                        title="Zahran, 1999">[3]</a></sup></p>
            <p>Crop rotation also affects other important aspects of farming systems, including weed management, soil
                erosion control, and overall soil health. Through diversified plant growth and residue, crop rotation
                can
                contribute to the improved physical and biological characteristics of the soil, including increased
                organic
                matter and enhanced soil microbial diversity. <sup><a href="sources.html#mohler2009"
                        title="Mohler & Johnson, 2009">[1]</a></sup>
            </p>
            <p>The exact sequence and choice of crops in a rotation schedule depend on several factors. These include
                local
                climate, available resources (including labor), soil type, and the gardener's objectives and priorities
                (resource efficiency, cost saving, or personal taste). In isolation, crop rotation requires a
                comprehensive
                understanding of crop biology and local conditions. Existing commercially available and open-source
                software
                developed to facilitate access to this information are focused on large scale analysis, leaving a
                substantial information gap for small-scale gardeners. <sup><a href="sources.html#dury2012"

            <h2>Data Source for Crop Rotation Modeling</h2>
            <p>
                The optimization model for crop rotation within GartenApp will utilize data primarily sourced from
                <em>Crop
                    Sequence Problems and Opportunities</em>, compiled by Charles L. Mohler. This compilation provides a
                robust
                foundation of empirical data and researched insights into effective crop sequences, which are critical
                for
                enhancing the algorithm's accuracy and relevance.
            </p>
            <p>
                Below is a snippet from Mohler's compilation, illustrating the type of data that will inform our
                modeling:
