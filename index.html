            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>My name is Erik Hempelmann, and I am currently an 8th semester Master's student in Applied Biology at
                Hochschule Bremen, programmer, product manager, and autodidact. My academic journey began in 2016
                when I embarked
                on my Biology studies with a growing interest in data analytics related to biological sciences.</p>
            <p>During my undergraduate studies, I undertook a significant challenge: my bachelor's thesis focused on a
                comprehensive
                big data analysis comparing the DNA sequences of <i>Daphnia magna</i> and <i>Daphnia pulex</i> globin
                species. This
                six-month endeavor
                painfully highlighted the inadequacies of my academic preparation for such a complex task. Despite the
                struggles,
                including considerable efforts with Microsoft Excel, I managed to produce a thesis that, while not
                stellar, was coherent
                and sufficient to earn my degree. This experience left me determined to find more capable tools for
                managing similar
                data-intensive tasks.</p>
            <p>Unable to meet the grade requirements for bioinformatics courses, I pursued an alternative path and
                applied to the ISTAB
                Masterâ€™s program at Hochschule Bremen. This program offered a flexible curriculum with a strong emphasis
                on statistics
                in its first semester, which turned out to be enlightening. Under the guidance of Dr. Robert Taube, I
                was
                introduced to
                the world of programming through a project that involved writing a small statistics script in R. This
                experience opened
                my eyes to the vast possibilities that programming languages offer.</p>
            <p>The COVID-19 pandemic, while a period of global difficulty, provided me with the time to deepen my
                programming skills. I
                transitioned from R to writing solutions in Rust, a lower-level programming language, allowing me to
                develop several
                functional programs, including a blockchain trading bot and an evaluation program using performance
                metrics. My academic and practical experience further expanded when I tackled an analytics
                and visualization
                project for FTIR spectroscopy, which introduced me to Python, adding another powerful tool to my
                repertoire.</p>

                <h2>Career Development</h2>
                <p>Simultaneously, I began working with a biogas plant operator consulting agency and specialized in
                    energy
                    consulting. This
                    position enabled me to develop an automation application tailored to energy management, which proved
                    to be a financial
                    success for the company. Upon completion of the application, I was offered
                    a role as a product
                    manager at the company's headquarters. Due to familial responsibilities and financial pressure I
                    accepted this offer.</p>
                <p>Upon completing my last course before my Master's degree in March 2023, I reconnected with Dr. Robert
                    Taube to discuss the possibility of writing my master's thesis under his tutelage. We
                    explored the potential of developing a mobile or web application designed
                    to gather data on
                    crop horticulture. Our aim was to provide users with a sophisticated optimization model for crop
                    rotation schemes.</p>

                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>In this project overview, I will provide a concise history of the project, discuss any relevant
                    previous findings, and
                    outline a detailed plan for its future development. My goal is to delineate the project's milestones
                    with as much
                    precision as possible based on the current status. I will, however, readily acknowledge my
                    limitations in the
                    area of web
                    development, a skill gap that became evident and has occasionally impeded progress throughout this
                    project's
                    development and which I have done my utmost to overcome. These experiences drive my commitment to
                    continual learning and improvement as we
                    move forward.</p>
